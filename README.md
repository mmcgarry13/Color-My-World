About The Project
![alt text](image.png)

Tt's what it sounds like. Color-My-World is a versatile color generator designed to assist with color selection and matching. The tool allows users to input any color hex code and generates a coordinated palette by calculating adjacent, complementary, triad, light, and dark variations. Additionally, Color-My-World features a random color generator that produces a hex code and automatically generates the same range of color selections from the randomly selected base color. This project is ideal for designers, developers, and anyone looking to explore or refine color schemes for creative work.

Our first bootcamp project is an important step in our software development journey. We are using our newly aquired skills and knowledge to build an application from scratch. Color-My-World is our team's execution of this projects requirements: to conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by storing data received from users in the browser and integrating it into our application. 

We are learning agile development methodologies and implementing feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.
